## Develop New Levels ##

Onion's Life has an intuitive level builder that you can access [here](https://onion-s-life-level-editor.vercel.app)! Here's how you can take your brand new creation and run it in Onion's Life:

1. Go to the [builder](https://onion-s-life-level-editor.vercel.app)
2. Choose `Export Level`
3. Go to Onion's Life
4. Start the game and press `L` on the keyboard
5. Paste in your level code that you exported and click `Ok`
6. Play forward to the last level of the game. It will turn into an `undefined` level with your new setup

Congratulations! You developed a new level for Onion's Life! When it's ready to deploy, create a PR into the [levels.js](levels.js) file.
